# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Instructions
#### The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:
- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Create the Crowdfunding Database

#### Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Data from the ```crowdfunding.xlsx``` file, located in the ```Resources``` folder, will be extracted and transformed to create **Category** and **Subcategory** dataframes.
  - Dataframes will be exported into the following CSV files: ```category.csv``` and ```subcategory.csv```. These exports can be found in the ```Resources``` folder.
- The code that was created to complete this ETL process can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file titled ```ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_KHuynh_WGoold_CRenteria```.

#### Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Data from the ```crowdfunding.xlsx``` file, located in the ```Resources``` folder, will be extracted and transformed to create **Campaign** dataframe.
  - The dataframes will be exported into the following CSV file: ```campaign.csv```. This export can be found in the ```Resources``` folder.
- The code that was created to complete this ETL process can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file titled ```ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_KHuynh_WGoold_CRenteria```.

#### Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Data from the ```crowdfunding.xlsx``` file, located in the ```Resources``` folder, will be extracted and transformed to create **Campaign** dataframe.
  - The dataframes will be exported into the following CSV file: ```campaign.csv```. This export can be found in the ```Resources``` folder.
- The code that was created to complete this ETL process can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file titled ```ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_KHuynh_WGoold_CRenteria```.

#### Create the Crowdfunding Database
- The crowdfunding database will be created using the (4) CSV files created in the first 3 parts.
- An ERD will be created to generate a table schema for each CSV file.

  - Crowdfunding database schema: ```crowdfunding_db_schema.sql```
